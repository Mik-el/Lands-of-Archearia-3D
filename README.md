## Game Download
I'm facing temporary problems doing commits and pushes on my repos, and the github web interface doesn't allow me to upload the game cause it's bigger than 25 Mb.
To solve this I've temporarily uploaded the game on MEGA ( https://mega.nz/file/rcBXxIBJ#WWlYCk4oiGJ87EPt-wp6UIryp9qN_F3-SiU1fW7cKFU ) but in the next hours and before the 1st of July, I'll result to fix the commit bug and upload all the files, here too! 

## Game Download, an Update:
The 25mb limit can be exceeded if using Git Bash, but Github refuses files bigger than 100Mb!
Even using Git Bash there's no way I can upload the game on Github, both if compressed or not.
When this game is compressed with 7zip, it weights around 250Mb, and if it's uncompressed there's at least one file that weights more than 100Mb.
I must use an external mirror. So please download the game from the link above, thank you :)
